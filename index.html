		<h2>Past Projects</h2>

		<div class="projects">
		<h2>Bringing Miel Milsantos to life; A Live2D project</h2>
		<p>Creating Miel was a week long project where I challenged
		   myself to learn the process of bringing a Live2D Model
		   to life in a week, and finish the week with a clear 
		   understanding of the technical and creative skill
		   behind it.<br><br> Live 2D is an animation technique
		   used to animate static images; it involves separating
		   the image into parts and animating each part
		   accordingly This enables characters to move in 2.5D 
		   movement, while maintaining original illustration.
			<br><br>
			In a week, I underwent all phases of sketching, illustrating,
			 cutting and finally animating my model. Miel was a journey 
			 meant to show that I take initiative with learning things, 
			 adapting and rising to new challenges. <br><br> To learn Live2D
			  animation software and finish a project on it was an enjoyable
			 journey that sprouted the passion for animating in Live2D. As of
			  today, Miel is an integral part of my weekend D&D sessions. <br><br>
			  Live2D can be used with real-time motion capture to track movements 
			  such as head movements, eye movements, and perform lip syncing for real-time 
			  applications. I had the idea of bringing her to life from the need 
			  for a more creative and visual approach to a hobby of mine, creating a 
			  more immersive and engaging experience and bringing a new immersive aspect 
			  to our fantasy world. </p>

		<h2>My Animation Experience</h2>
		<p>Following my multimedia arts education, I've worked on 4	
		different short film projects: My first project being a 
		collaboration with Erasmus, to partner with a school abroad
		in the production of an educational video to be shown to 
		other students. I researched and wrote on marijuana and 
		it's medicinal uses. I have lost this media file, as it 
		was developed amid Covid sending students home from
		schools.<br><br>My second film was "Apples and moments
		of magic", my final highschool graduation project. <br><br> 
			During my years in university, I worked on a smaller project 
		called <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFYwVLSd5c/TLnjQb8HrlMIDaKycJqaZQ/edit?utm_content=DAFYwVLSd5c&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">"Dribble"</a>, and later I started writing and doing
		pre-production for <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFkN19hNW0/rqU3OCrU9q8yjgKBXYsadQ/edit?utm_content=DAFkN19hNW0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">"Unmasked"</a>. </p>

		<h2>Social Media Assistant</h2>

			content planning & designing media assets with Rita Penteado,
